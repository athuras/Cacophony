# Cacophony: Experimental Real-time digital synthesis engine.

Originally this was intended to be a non-trivial project that I could leverage to learn a new systems programming language.
My earliest attempts using Haskell proved to be difficult; in that a lot of the necessary library bindings (namely portaudio, portmidi) were unstable and/or unmaintained.
I shifted to Rust, and tried again.
I got about as far, and luckily (because the libraries were so young) everything worked.

Months pass.

Recent revisions to Rust have made all the libraries unstable, so I'm more-or-less at ground zero. Additionally, I haven't had access to my primary development environment for quite some time.

So here is where everything stands:

1. I really want to learn Haskell, since I initially found Rust's style to be distasteful (not quite as functional as I'd like, but there is ultimately nothing wrong with that, and I really have only reached the tip of the iceberg).
2. The RePa package for haskell is pretty sweet, and I'd like to use it for some of the more mathy parts of the synth engine. Also Monads.

Months pass.

Haskell-takeover.
