# Cacophony: Experimental Real-time digital synthesis engine.

## The goal:

1. Use Haskell for a large project.
2. Keep my DSP knowledge fresh.
3. Appreciate writing software with real-time constraints
4. Make Music.

## Tools

1. Haskell
2. PortAudio, PortMidi, and associated Haskell Bindings
3. Repa, FFTW or similar DSP libs depending on the performance of Repa.

Midi Controller -> PortMidi -> Magic -> PortAudio -> Sound
